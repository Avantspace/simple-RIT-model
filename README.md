Description:
The discharge parameters were simulated using a hydrodynamic plasma model based on papers by P. Chabert and D. Goebel. The main dependences of the model were the equations of energy and particle balance, where the independent variables are the density and temperature of the neutrals (ng, Tg) and electrons (n, Te).
